        <h5>ACT II<br>
            Scene — Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
            discovered,
                 singing to Zara.<br>
          
                              RECITATIVE — Fitzbattleaxe.
          
                      Oh, Zara, my beloved one, bear with me!
                      Ah, do not laugh at my attempted C!
                      Repent not, mocking maid, thy girlhood's choice—
                      The fervour of my love affects my voice!</h5>
            <p>Zara:     Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
                qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
                notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
                thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
                (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
                hand in his), you have that already! <br>
              
                Fitz.:    How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
                practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
                material from the merely incidental! <br>
              
                Zara:     My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
                idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
                all working marvelously well?  Have not our Flowers of Progress
                more than justified their name? <br>
              
                Fitz.:    We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
                have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
                services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
                trembles at the name of Utopia! <br> <br>

                Lord D.:  Certainly—nothing simpler.  Kindly bring your
  chairs forward—His Majesty will, of course, preside. 

  (They range their chairs across stage like Christy Minstrels.
  King sits center, Lord Dramaleigh on his left, Mr. Goldbury on his
  right, Captain Corcoran left of Lord Dramaleigh, Captain
  Fitzbattleaxe right of Mr. Goldbury, Mr. Blushington extreme
  right, Sir Bailey Barre extreme left.) <br>

  King:     Like this? <br>

  Lord D.:  Like this. <br>

  King:     We take your word for it that this is all right.  You
  are not making fun of us?  This is in accordance with the prac-
  tice at the Court of St. James's? <br>

  Lord D.:  Well, it is in accordance with the practice at the Court
  of St. James's Hall. <br>

  King:     Oh! it seems odd, but never mind. <br> <br>
  King:     Defunct?  Is that so?  Dear, dear, I am truly sorry. <br>

  Scaphio:  Are you aware that Sir Bailey Barre has introduced a law
  of libel by which all editors of scurrilous newspapers are pub-
  licly flogged—as in England?  And six of our editors have
  resigned in succession!  Now, the editor of a scurrilous paper can
  stand a good deal—he takes a private thrashing as a matter
  of course—it's considered in his salary—but no
  gentleman likes to be publicly flogged. <br>

  King:     Naturally.  I shouldn't like it myself. <br>

  Phantis:  Then our Burlesque Theater is absolutely ruined! <br>

  King:     Dear me.  Well, theatrical property is not what it was.<br> <br>
  Tarara:   Naturally.

  Scaphio:  Then you won't unless you join us.  The King has defied
  us, and, as matters stand, we are helpless.  So are you.  We must
  devise some plot at once to bring the people about his ears. <br>

  Tarara:   A plot? <br>

  Phantis:  Yes, a plot of superhuman subtlety.  Have you such a
  thing about you? <br>

  Tarara:   (feeling)  No, I think not.  No.  There's one on my
  dressing-table. <br>

  Scaphio:  We can't wait—we must concoct one at once, and put
  it into execution without delay.  There is not a moment to spare!<br> <br>

  Sca.:     Suppose we all—(whispers) <br>
  Phan.:         Now there I think you're right.
            Then we might all—(whispers) <br>
  Tar.:          That's true, we certainly might.
            I'll tell you what—(whispers) <br>
  Sca.:          We will if we possibly can.
            Then on the spot— (whispers) <br>
  Phan. and Tar.:     Bravo!  A capital plan! <br>
  Sca.:     That's exceedingly neat and new! <br>
  Phan.:    Exceedingly new and neat.<br>
  Tar.:     I fancy that that will do. <br>
  Sca.:          It's certainly very complete. <br>
  Phan.:    Well done you sly old sap! <br>
  Tar.:          Bravo, you cunning old mole! <br>
  Sca.:     You very ingenious chap! <br>
  Phan.:         You intellectual soul!<br> <br>
  Gold.:    My dear Dramaleigh, it redounds infinitely to your
  credit. <br>

  Lord D.:  One or two judicious innovations, I think? <br>

  Gold.:    Admirable.  The cup of tea and the plate of mixed
  biscuits were a cheap and effective inspiration. <br>

  Lord D.:  Yes—my idea entirely.  Never been done before. <br>

  Gold.:    Pretty little maids, the King's youngest daughters, but
  timid. <br>

  Lord D.:  That'll wear off.  Young. <br>

  Gold.:    That'll wear off.  Ha! here they come, by George!  And
  with-out the Dragon!  What can they have done with her?<br><br>

  Kalyba:   Are you?  I wonder why. <br>

  Nekaya:   Don't tell us if it's rude. <br>

  Lord D.:  Rude?  Not at all.  We are obliged to Lady Sophy because
  she has afforded us the pleasure of seeing you. <br>

  Nekaya:   I don't think you ought to talk to us like that. <br>

  Kalyba:   It's calculated to turn our heads. <br>

  Nekaya:   Attractive girls cannot be too particular. <br>

  Kalyba:   Oh pray, pray do not take advantage of our unprotected
  inno-cence. <br>

  Gold.:    Pray be reassured—you are in no danger whatever. <br>

  Lord D.:  But may I ask—is this extreme delicacy—this
  shrinking sensitiveness—a general characteristic of Utopian
  young ladies? <br>

  Nekaya:   Oh no; we are crack specimens.<br> <br>
