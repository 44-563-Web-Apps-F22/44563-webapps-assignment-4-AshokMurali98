        <h4>ACT II<br>
            Scene — Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
            discovered,
                 singing to Zara.
         </h4> 
         <h4 class="name fitz">Fitzbattleaxe.</h4>
         <p class="speech fitz">Oh, Zara, my beloved one, bear with me!
            Ah, do not laugh at my attempted C!
            Repent not, mocking maid, thy girlhood's choice—
            The fervour of my love affects my voice!</p>
         
            <h4 class="name fitz">Fitzbattleaxe.</h4>
             <p class="song"> A tenor, all singers above
                (This doesn't admit of a question),
                     Should keep himself quiet,
                     Attend to his diet
                And carefully nurse his digestion;
           But when he is madly in love
                It's certain to tell on his singing—
                     You can't do the proper chromatics
                     With proper emphatics
                When anguish your bosom is wringing!
           When distracted with worries in plenty,
           And his pulse is a hundred and twenty,
           And his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is,
           A tenor can't do himself justice,
                Now observe—(sings a high note),
           You see, I can't do myself justice!
           I could sing if my fervour were mock,
                It's easy enough if you're acting—
                     But when one's emotion
                     Is born of devotion
                You mustn't be over-exacting.
           One ought to be firm as a rock
                To venture a shake in vibrato,
                     When fervour's expected
                     Keep cool and collected
                Or never attempt agitato.
           But, of course, when his tongue is of leather,
           And his lips appear pasted together,
           And his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is,
           A tenor can't do himself justice.
                Now observe—(sings a high note),
           It's no use—I can't do myself justice!</p>
        <h4 class="name zara">ZAR:</h4>
        <p class="song zara">Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
            qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
            notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
            thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
            (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
            hand in his), you have that already!</p>     
                     
        <h4 class="ngame fitz">FIT:</h4>
                <p class="song fitz">How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
                    practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
                    material from the merely incidental!</p> 

        <h4 class="name lord">LOR:</h4>
                <p class="song lord">Certainly—nothing simpler.  Kindly bring your
                                chairs forward—His Majesty will, of course, preside.</p>

        
        <h4 class="name zara">ZAR:</h4>
                    <p class="song zara">My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
                        idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
                        all working marvelously well?  Have not our Flowers of Progress
                        more than justified their name?</p>        
                
        <h4 class="name fitz">FIT:</h4>
                    <p class="song fitz">We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
                        have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
                        services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
                        trembles at the name of Utopia!</p> 

        <h4 class="name zara">ZAR:</h4>
                        <p class="song zara">How clever of you!</p>        
                    
        <h4 class="name fitz">FIT:</h4>
                        <p class="song fitz">Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
                            Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
                            with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
                            idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
                            full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
                            never dreamt of!</p>
