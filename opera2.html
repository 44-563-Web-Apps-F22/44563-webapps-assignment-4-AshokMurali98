        <h4>ACT II<br>
            Scene â€” Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
            discovered,
                 singing to Zara.
        </h4>
    <h4 class="name zara">ZAR</h4>
    <p class="speech zara"> Words of love too loudly spoken
        Ring their own untimely knell;
   Noisy vows are rudely broken,
        Soft the song of Philomel.
   Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,
        Hour by hour and day by day;
   Sweet and low as accents holy
        Are the notes of lover's lay.</p>

    <h4 class="name king">KIN</h4>
        <p class="song king">To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
        use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
        perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
        all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
        sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
        Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
        impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
        Articles of Association?
